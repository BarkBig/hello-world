# hello-world
Short legs is the description of my little westie.
He is almost 16 which in westie years is absolutely older than dirt.
He requires constant attention and lets me know it is always 'snack-thirty'.
His current favorite snack is free-range, artisanal pork skins.
His second favorite snack is anything I am eating.
